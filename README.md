# API Documentation

#### 1️⃣ Backend deployed at [Heroku](https://lambda-how-to.herokuapp.com/) <br>

## 1️⃣ Getting started

To get the server running locally:

- Clone this repo
- **yarn install** to install all required dependencies
- **yarn server** to start the local server
- **yarn test** to start server using testing environment

### Node.js and Express

-    These are what everyone on the team is most familiar with.
-    It is more dynamic and easier to read than other frameworks.
-    Express gives us route support.
-    Node.js is known for offering high performance, and the freedom to develop without restrictions.
-    Express offers lightweight middleware support for routes.

## 2️⃣ Actions

🚫 This is an example, replace this with the actions that pertain to your backend

`getAllUsers()` -> Returns all registered users

`getUserById(id)` -> Returns a specified user by Id

`getAllPosts()` -> Returns all created posts

`getPostById(id)` -> Returns a specified post by Id

## 3️⃣ Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables.

create a .env file that includes the following:

🚫 These are just examples, replace them with the specifics for your app
    
    *  PORT - what port the server will run on
    *  HOST - set to "localhost" for "development" and "testing"
    *  DB_DEV - the name of the local PostgreSQL database cluster for development
    *  DB_TEST - the name of the local PostgreSQL database cluster for testing
    *  USER - the username set for your local PostgreSQL server
    *  PASS - the password set for your local PostgreSQL server
